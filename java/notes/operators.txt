//post increment (works for char and double too)
	int a = 1;//2
	int b = a++;//1
	(here the value of a will be assigned to b, and then a will increase by one)
	OR
	System.put.println(a++);1 (here we print the initial value and only hen increase it by 1)
	

//pre increment
	int a = 1;//2
	int b = ++a;//2
	(here FIRST we increase a by 1, and then assign it to b)
	
//post decrement
	int x = 2;//1
	int y = x--;//2
	(here the value of a will be assigned to y, and then a will decrease by one)

//pre decrement
	int x = 2;//1
	int y =--a;//1
	(here FIRST we decrease by 1, and then assign it to y)

WORKS FOR CHAR AND DOUBLE TOO..
BUT FOR CHAR WORKS IN THIS WAY => char l = 'a'; => l++ => 'b'
