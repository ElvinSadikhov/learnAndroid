//this class allows us to change and manupilate strings(this class is not String type)
	StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("Hello");


//add something to the END of the initial string
	s.append(char); => char is String,int,double,char...(anything)

//insert something in the given position
	s.insert(pos,letter); => pos is int, and letter is anything you want

//find a char(type char) at the given position
	s.charAt(pos); => returns type char! ('C') WITH SINGLE QUOTES

//changing existing letter with another(char)
	s.setCharAt(pos,letter) => pos is int, and letter is type char!('T') SINGLE QUOTES!

//returns a String version of sequence
	s.toString(); => value is not type StringBuilder anymore! It's String type
