//Java has three built-in annotations:
- @Override : Checks that the method is an override. Causes a compile error if the method is not found in one of the parent classes or implemented interfaces.
- @SuppressWarnings : Instructs the compiler to suppress the compile time warnings specified in the annotation parameters.
- @Deprecated : Marks the method as obsolete. Causes a compile warning if the method is used.
