//Array is a static type array
//the size cant be changed
//WE CAN ACCESS VALUES BY INDEXES EASILY

//initializing
	int[] x; (no storage, just type)
	int[] x = new int[12]; (creates 12 places with the value of 0)
	String[] s = new String[12]; (creates 12 places with the value of null)
	OR
	int[] x = {1,2,4,4,3};
	String[] s = {"hello","bye"};

//we can read and write via indexes
	s[3] = "Hello"; (we put "Hello" in the position 3)
	x[2] = x[3] + 4; (we read and wrote at the same time)

//length-it is not a method, it's an attribute (Array's length cannot change)
	x.length; (NOT x.length())
